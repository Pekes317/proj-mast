Whether our needs are urgent or standard, Peter is consultative, kind, quick and thorough—and we very much appreciate his work to keep the field informed. If I could send him a BRAVO, I would, but this will have to do for now."

    "message": "Hi! I just tried to send a BRAVO to Peter Mast, but didn’t realize I couldn’t since he’s a contractor. In lieu of doing it through the official system, I just wanted to say thanks to Peter for his ongoing support of our LINKnet sites. We manage a number of sites on our team and he’s always a big help. Sometimes our requests get pretty detailed, undergo changes, or are sent to him incomplete, and he is always very accommodating and does so with a great attitude. Thanks, Peter, for your support!"

He’s always responsive and on the ball with the LINKnet updates he’s worked on for me, and has been particularly helpful on the corporate UPAF campaign. He’s been very efficient when we’ve had changes to make to the UPAF and UPAF Coordinator sites, and has jumped on the edits very quickly as well. Having him working with us has really helped things run smoothly. Kudos to Peter!"
